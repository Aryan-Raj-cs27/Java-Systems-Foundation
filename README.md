# Java Systems Foundation ☕🏛️

A comprehensive archive documenting **5+ years of Java development**, tracing my journey from algorithmic logic building in high school (ISC) to Object-Oriented Programming in University.

## 📂 Repository Structure
This repository serves as a timeline of my coding evolution:

| Segment | Focus Area | Era |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **IILM Semester 3** | OOPs, Inheritance, Polymorphism, File Handling | 2024 (University) |
| **ISC Archive** | Core Algorithms, Sorting (Bubble/Selection), Recursion | 2019-2023 (High School) |

## 🚀 Why this matters
Unlike modern frameworks that abstract logic away, this codebase represents **raw logic building**.
- **No Frameworks:** Pure Java (`java.util.*`, `java.io.*`).
- **Algorithm Heavy:** Custom implementations of sorting, searching, and matrix operations.
- **Consistency:** Evidence of continuous coding practice since 2019.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Java (SE 8 through 17)
- **Tools:** BlueJ (Early years), VS Code (Current)
- **Concepts:** Arrays, Recursion, OOPs, Exception Handling.
